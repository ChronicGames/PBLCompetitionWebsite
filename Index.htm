	<p>Hello, welcome to <i>Clothes R' Us</i>. We are a non-profit organization with the sole purpose of providing people in need with gently used
		 clothing. There are many ways to express yourself and show someone that you care. We think that giving someone comfortable and warm clothing,
		 is a great way to help not just them, but yourself. If giving is something that interests you, or you just have a lot of old clothes 
		 cluttering your wardrobe, you can easily donate them either by packaging them and shipping them to us. You could also bring them to our store, if 
		 you live close enough.</p>
		
		
		


	<p>Clothes are also a big deal when trying to find a job. In modern society it is hard to aquire a job, no matter the job, unless you have 
		 clean, presentable clothing. This is a big problem with homeless people in our country. They are unable to get a home because they can not get 
		 a job, due to their appearance. This is why we also offer free makeovers for anyone that asks. Our makeover consists of new clothing and a haircut. 
		 Makeup and a lesson from an experienced cosmetologist is also available to whosoever chooses to partake.</p>
		
	<p>We also have a large sectioned fitting room. This ensures that people do not have to guess about whether or not it will fit. You can try it on 
		 and you will know. Our fitting room is available for use anytime that we are open.</p>
		

		
	<p>There is also a room in our store specifically for the kids while they are waiting. We understand that you may have multiple children and 
		 getting them to all sit still and stay quiet isn't always easy. This is why we created the KidZone. Want to know more? Click here - 
	  <a href="KidZone.htm" title="Kid Zone">KidZone</a></p>
		
	<p>You may be wondering how we are able to provide such a variety of services for free, wonder no more. The reason that we are able to do all 
		 of this is because we have spent years developing a large network of individuals and organizations with kind hearts. This means that we can not 
		 only have quality clothing for free but also advice from experts in any field. We would love to help in any way we can and the most effective 
		 way that we know of to do this is empowerment. Giving someone the knowledge and confidence to be successful in any endeavor, is a great way to spend your time.</p>
